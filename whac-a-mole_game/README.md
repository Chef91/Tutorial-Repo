# Welcome to Whac-A-Mole
The game you are about to play was inspired by the tutorial <a href="https://github.com/ImKennyYip/whac-a-mole">whac-a-mole</a> on github.

This project is honestly a lot of fun and inspiring. It taught me about how (JS) JavaScript can create divs & images. How to click on images/distribute points, and create a fast and simple JS time killer game.
