# Welcome to Whac-A-Mole
The game you are about to play was inspired by the tutorial <a href="https://github.com/ImKennyYip/whac-a-mole">whac-a-mole</a> on github.

This project is honestly a lot of fun and inspiring. It taught me about how (JS) JavaScript can create divs & images. How to click on images/distribute points, and create a fast and simple JS time killer game.

Improvements:
- Start Button
- Scoreboard
- Logging scores
- ranking system
- mobile/responsive friendly

These are things i would want to add after playing the tutorial to further teach myself js games.
